The <em>Dedicated type</em> and <em>Honored entity</em> FEs each form part of the Lexical Units (annotated on the second FE layer), and the <em>Dedicated entity</em> is the denotation of the whole.  Since each of the FEs is a part of the Lexical Unit, there is no assignment of Grammatical Function or Phrase Type.  The <em>Dedicated type</em> should (in principle) also be annotated as a LU in a separate frame.  Targets are added opportunistically to this frame in the course of annotating other frames.

The <em>Phenomenon</em> may be incorporated into the wider knowledge structure via categorization, which can be indicated by the mention of a <em>Category</em>. The <em>Cognizer</em> may possess knowledge only in part and this may be expressed in a <em>Completeness</em> expression. The <em>Cognizer</em> may also be realized as a cognitive-emotional <em>Faculty</em> that is conceived of as having understanding. Note that the knowledge may have been acquired either from instruction or from the <em>Cognizer</em>'s own experimentation, observation, or mental operations.","<p class='list-group-item'>Our sensations  are in some sense to be <span id='phrase_example'>understood</span>  in terms of a set of stimulation levels (spiking frequencies) in the appropriate sensory pathways .   </p><p class='list-group-item'> The mind  is often unable to <span id='phrase_example'>comprehend</span>  the significance of what it perceives .</p><p class='list-group-item'>I realized  I  had not  properly  <span id='phrase_example'>understood</span>  my own needs </p><p class='list-group-item'>Nobody seems to have explained this to her, but  finally   she  <span id='phrase_example'>understands</span>   </p><p class='list-group-item'> The draughtsman  must  fully  <span id='phrase_example'>comprehend</span>  what he is drawing </p><p class='list-group-item'> My father  failed to <span id='phrase_example'>comprehend</span>  that his explanations were based as much upon faith as mine </p><p class='list-group-item'>I figured this out last week and now  I   really  <span id='phrase_example'>understand</span>  it .</p>"
f:Remembering_experience,"A <em>Cognizer</em> calls up an episodic memory of past <em>Experience</em> or an <em>Impression</em> of a <em>Salient entity</em> formed  on the basis of past experience. The <em>Cognizer</em> may also remember  the <em>Salient entity</em> in a particular <em>State</em>, which serves as a frame of reference in the <em>Cognizer</em>'s mind.   When attention is focused on a <em>Salient entity</em>, then mention of a global <em>Experience</em> is excluded and typically, but not always, either a <em>State</em> or <em>Impression</em> of the <em>Salient entity</em> is presented.<ex/>Episodic memory is the  explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts.

f:Similarity,"Two or more distinct entities, which may be concrete or abstract objects or types, are characterized as being similar to each other.   The similarity may be based on appearance, physical properties, or other characteristics of the two entities. However, no such <em>Dimension</em> has to  be specified explicitly.  The <em>Entities</em> may be like each other to a greater or lesser <em>Degree</em>. Rather than specifying the <em>Dimension</em> of difference, a <em>Differentiating fact</em> may be mentioned.",<p class='list-group-item'>Lothlorien is quite <span id='phrase_example'>like</span> most of their other war games  really.</p><p class='list-group-item'> Great Britain and Germany were only <span id='phrase_example'>alike</span>  in one respect .</p><p class='list-group-item'> Recovering it afterwards  can also be <span id='phrase_example'>similar</span>  to collecting an unsecured loan  </p><p class='list-group-item'>A mulberry   is   very  <span id='phrase_example'>similar</span>   in shape    to a loganberry</p>
f:Subjective_influence,"An <em>Agent</em>, <em>Situation</em> or <em>Entity</em> has an influence on a <em>Cognizer</em>. The influence may be general; or it may be manifested in the <em>Cognizer</em>'s engaging in an <em>Action</em> as a consequence of the influence; or the <em>Cognizer</em> may be influenced in how they carry out a <em>Behavior</em> that they are engaged in already. Alternatively, a <em>Product</em> may be specified whose production or design was influenced by the <em>Cognizer</em>'s experience of the  <em>Situation</em> or <em>Entity</em>.","<p class='list-group-item'>I'm sure if I asked Mattel  what  <span id='phrase_example'>inspired</span>  this car  I would be told it's an original design, and not supposed to represent any actual car.</p><p class='list-group-item'> These works  had a profound effect and <span id='phrase_example'>influenced</span>  her   in the creation of a successful series capturing this sun-drenched region .</p>"

f:Categorization,"A <em>Cognizer</em> construes an <em>Item</em> as belonging to a certain <em>Category</em>.  In this process, the <em>Cognizer</em> may either passively perceive the <em>Item</em> and note that it fits the <em>Criteria</em> for a <em>Category</em>, or, alternatively, actively examine the <em>Item</em> for certain <em>Criteria</em> that define a <em>Category</em> (or set of <em>Category</em>s).","<p class='list-group-item'>You  've already <span id='phrase_example'>stereotyped</span>  me   as a bimbo , have n't you?</p>"

f:Detaching,"The definition covers two situations: a scene in which somebody causes one thing to be physically detached from something else; or a scene in which somebody causes two things to be disconnected from each other. In the first,  an <em>Agent</em> detaches an <em>Item</em> from a <em>Source</em>, creating an asymmetric relationship between the <em>Item</em> and the <em>Source</em>. In the second, the <em>Agent</em> attaches two <em>Items</em> to each other, where each serves as a <em>Source</em> relative to the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two <em>Items</em>.

f:Colonization,"A group of <em>Colonists</em> from a <em>Homeland</em> migrate to and proceed to settle in a <em>New area</em>. The <em>New area</em> then becomes their permanent home. The <em>New area</em> and <em>Homeland</em> are in some way construed as being part of the same organization or system. In the case of (people from) nation-states colonizing other areas, the colony and nation-state are considered a single political entity. In the extended sense of living things in general colonizing or settling a new area, the original <em>Homeland</em> must still inhabited by some of the same group.

f:Purpose,"An <em>Agent</em> wants to achieve a <em>Goal</em>,  or an object, a <em>Means</em> , has been created or is used to allow the creator or a  user to achieve a  <em>Goal</em>. The <em>Goal</em> is a state of the world that does not currently obtain but which the <em>Agent</em> wants to realize and is planning and/or working towards. In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the <em>Agent</em> or the <em>Means</em> (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as <em>Agent</em> on the first layer but also annotate them as <em>Means</em> on a second annotation layer.In some cases a <em>Restrictor</em> on the <em>Goal</em> state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talk about <em>Goal</em>s frequently includes the mention of a <em>Domain</em> to which the <em>Agent</em>'s <em>Goal</em> is relevant.",<p class='list-group-item'>The president's  economic <span id='phrase_example'>goal</span> for the country  was to overcome the recession .</p><p class='list-group-item'> My <span id='phrase_example'>goal</span> in this book is to introduce the reader to Web programming applications .</p><p class='list-group-item'> The prime <span id='phrase_example'>goal</span>  of the programme  was  to help develop processes of scientific thinking in children  .</p><p class='list-group-item'>The <span id='phrase_example'>object</span>  of the tutorial  is  to help a student concentrate on his writing skills  </p><p class='list-group-item'>The modest  American  <span id='phrase_example'>goal</span>  of a threefold increase in capacity  recognises this fact .</p>
f:Summarizing,"A <em>Communicator</em> processes some information (either from textual or real-world/perceptual sources) regarding a <em>State of affairs</em> into a concise form (a summary) that contains the essential content in briefer form, and communicates this summary to an <em>Addressee</em>, or records it in a <em>Medium</em>. The <em>State of affairs</em> may be represented directly (e.g., outline what happened, the situation abroad), or as a textual source (summarizing the documents), or metonymically as some focal entity (a synopsis of the candidates).Some LUs, such as summarize and synopsis entail a preexisting body of information that has been processed into a briefer form by the <em>Communicator</em>. Others, such as outline and blueprint are compatible with, but do not entail, a preexisting, fully fleshed-out concept. E.g.,","<p class='list-group-item'>Her book <span id='phrase_example'>outlines</span> a new proposal for handling grammaticalization , though she doesn't flesh it out entirely.</p><p class='list-group-item'> In her materials ,  she  also <span id='phrase_example'>outlined</span>  the situation and major problems facing the company .</p><p class='list-group-item'> You  should be able to <span id='phrase_example'>summarize</span>  your findings   to a lay audience .</p><p class='list-group-item'> He <span id='phrase_example'>boiled</span><span id='phrase_example'>down</span> the argument for domestic wiretapping  in one plainspoken and effective, if also deceptive, line...</p><p class='list-group-item'> Director Van Auken <ment>gave</ment> a brief informational <span id='phrase_example'>synopsis</span>  of each applicant . </p><p class='list-group-item'> Frank  has already <span id='phrase_example'>summarized</span>  some of the reactions   on his weblog .</p>"
f:Amounting_to,"The absolute <em>Value</em> of a quantifiable <em>Attribute</em>  of an item is determined by adding up the values for the <em>Attribute</em> of the individuals or parts that make up the item. The item is not expressed as a separate constituent but it is presupposed by the concept of <em>Attribute</em>.  Alternatively, the <em>Numbers</em> form an implicit set whose sum is the <em>Value</em> associated with the set.   In some cases what is reported is just the cardinality of the individuals that make up the item so that in effect the <em>Value</em> is a count. In other cases the identity of the <em>Attribute</em> can only be inferred from the <em>Value</em>.","<p class='list-group-item'>The WHO estimated that the cumulative <span id='phrase_example'>total</span>  of AIDS cases  was  more than 1,500,000 . </p><p class='list-group-item'>   Revenues   <span id='phrase_example'>totalled</span>   568.86m pounds </p><p class='list-group-item'>Defence is provided in West Germany by  armed forces whose number  <span id='phrase_example'>totals</span>  close to half a million men and women</p>"

f:Being_in_effect,"A particular <em>Binding principle</em> is (or is not) operative, that is, any obligations, restrictions, and any other aspects of the <em>Binding principle</em> are (or are not) in effect.  The <em>Binding principle</em> can be expressed as being in effect for a particular <em>Duration</em>, or at a particular <em>Time</em> or <em>Place</em>, or under certain <em>Circumstances</em>. Although the <em>in effect</em> is properly in this definition, <em>(put) into effect</em> is analyzed in another definition. This is in part because to <em>put an (evacuation) plan into effect</em> is to actually execute the plan (to evacuate), while to <em>put a plan in effect</em> is to determine that in the future the plan may have to executed, i.e., to make the plan binding.

In the first, an<em>Agent</em> attaches an <em>Item</em> to a <em>Goal</em> by manipulating a <em>Connector</em>, creating an asymmetric relationship between the <em>Item</em> and the <em>Goal</em>.  In the second, the<em>Agent</em> attaches two <em>Items</em> to each other, where each serves as a <em>Goal</em> for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two <em>Items</em>. In both cases, the <em>Connector</em> remains to bind the two entities (either<em>Item</em> and <em>Goal</em>, or two <em>Items</em>), without creating a new entity.",<p class='list-group-item'>Make sure  you  <span id='phrase_example'>bind</span>  his wrists   as tightly as possible .</p><p class='list-group-item'> The robber <span id='phrase_example'>tied</span> Harry  to the chair .</p>

With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs <em>Perceiver_passive</em> and <em>Body_part</em>, respectively. (The <ment>-passive</ment> part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)","<p class='list-group-item'>The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing , <m>make</m> for a  surreal  <span id='phrase_example'>sight</span>.</p><p class='list-group-item'></p><p class='list-group-item'> Endill  <m>heard</m> the <span id='phrase_example'>noise</span>  of glass smashing, plaster crumbling and furniture being broken .</p><p class='list-group-item'></p><p class='list-group-item'>The <span id='phrase_example'>feel</span>  of his strong fingers enclosing her small palm  came as something of a shock to her system.</p>"

Like other locative relations, the <em>Figure</em> may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.","<p class='list-group-item'>The hand  <span id='phrase_example'>around</span>  the sword-hilt  was no less impressive than the sword .</p><p class='list-group-item'> The drug war  <span id='phrase_example'>straddles</span>  the border of the US and Mexico  .</p><p class='list-group-item'>that led to Dolce and Gabbana to  base their autumn/winter D and G collection  <span id='phrase_example'>around</span>  her style  in 2008</p><p class='list-group-item'>But he discovered that  the literary world  was a battlefield— mined with hatred, <span id='phrase_example'>rimmed</span>  with snipers . </p><p class='list-group-item'> Countless legends  sprung up <span id='phrase_example'>around</span>  the knight .</p><p class='list-group-item'>Common abstract entities that serve as <fen>Figure</fen> include emotions ('the hopelessness <span id='phrase_example'>surrounding</span> them'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies ('Ageism <span id='phrase_example'>surrounds</span> us, but passes largely unnoticed').</p>"
